sort1 uses: BubbleSort

How do you know?: 

I concluded this because in data already classified, sort 1 performed much faster than the classification by selection.

sort2 uses: MergeSort

How do you know?: 

I concluded this because in inverted values, sort 2 was the fastest algorithm.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: 

because for sorted data, sort 3 has almost the same time as for inverted or unclassified data.
